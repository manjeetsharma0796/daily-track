- Not everyone becomes billable 
- You may have to present a feature to client and your team members too.
- Seek for other opportunity to increase your learnings
- There may be delay in access, but in the meantime try to get context of the project you're working on. It will boost the work progress later and won't take too much time.
- People may delay in response, so have patience.
